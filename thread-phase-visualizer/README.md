# thread-phase-visualizer

Generic Pi-side event store and visualization extension for thread-phase workflows.

This is intentionally workflow-agnostic: workflows emit structured events and artifacts; the Pi extension watches those events and exposes them through generic tools/commands. Specific workflows should not implement their own TUI watchers.

## Store layout

Default store:

```text
~/.pi/agent/thread-phase/
├── index.jsonl          # global append-only event stream
├── runs/
│   └── <runId>.jsonl    # per-run event stream
└── artifacts/           # optional workflow-owned artifact location
```

Override with:

```bash
PI_THREAD_PHASE_STORE_DIR=/path/to/store
```

## Event schema

All events use this envelope:

```ts
type ThreadPhaseUiEvent = {
  schema: "thread-phase-ui/v1";
  eventId: string;
  timestamp: string;
  runId: string;
  workflow: string;
  cwd?: string;
  trigger?: unknown;
  type:
    | "workflow_start"
    | "workflow_end"
    | "phase_start"
    | "phase_event"
    | "phase_end"
    | "agent_event"
    | "artifact"
    | "error";
  phase?: string;
  status?: "running" | "success" | "failed" | "cancelled" | string;
  level?: "debug" | "info" | "warning" | "error" | string;
  message?: string;
  data?: unknown;
  artifact?: {
    kind: "markdown" | "file" | "url" | "json" | string;
    title: string;
    path?: string;
    content?: string;
    data?: unknown;
  };
};
```

## Workflow integration

Treat `lib/store.mjs` as the stable public workflow API. UI code should also read through this module rather than parsing JSONL directly.

Status constants are exported as `STATUSES`:

```ts
STATUSES.RUNNING   // "running"
STATUSES.SUCCESS   // "success"
STATUSES.FAILED    // "failed"
STATUSES.CANCELLED // "cancelled"
STATUSES.SKIPPED   // "skipped"
```

From a Node/TypeScript workflow runner:

```ts
import {
  STATUSES,
  createRun,
  phaseStart,
  phaseEvent,
  phaseEnd,
  artifact,
  completeRun,
  failRun,
} from "~/.pi/agent/extensions/thread-phase-visualizer/lib/store.mjs";

const run = createRun({
  workflow: "code-review",
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  trigger: { kind: "post-commit", ref: "HEAD" },
  input: { commit: "HEAD" },
});

try {
  phaseStart(run, "collect-diff");
  // ...work...
  phaseEnd(run, "collect-diff", STATUSES.SUCCESS);

  artifact(run, {
    kind: "markdown",
    title: "Review report",
    path: "/repo/.git/pi-code-reviews/abc123.md",
  });

  completeRun(run, STATUSES.SUCCESS);
} catch (error) {
  failRun(run, error);
}
```

For `runPipeline(...)`, either mirror the pipeline event stream:

```ts
import { mirrorPipelineEvents } from "~/.pi/agent/extensions/thread-phase-visualizer/lib/store.mjs";

for await (const event of mirrorPipelineEvents(runPipeline(phases, ctx), run)) {
  // existing logging if desired
}
```

Or wrap phase objects so phase start/end are emitted consistently:

```ts
import { wrapPhases } from "~/.pi/agent/extensions/thread-phase-visualizer/lib/store.mjs";

const visualizedPhases = wrapPhases(phases, run);
for await (const event of runPipeline(visualizedPhases, ctx)) {
  // normal thread-phase event handling
}
```

## Demo workflow

Generate sample events without running a real workflow:

```bash
~/.pi/agent/extensions/thread-phase-visualizer/bin/demo-workflow.mjs --cwd "$PWD"
~/.pi/agent/extensions/thread-phase-visualizer/bin/demo-workflow.mjs --cwd "$PWD" --fail
```

## Pi usage

- Tool: `thread_phase_runs`
- Command: `/thread-phase`
- Command: `/thread-phase run <runId>`

Current UI is deliberately minimal. The abstraction is the stable part; richer TUI components can be layered on top later by reading the same store.
